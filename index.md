As lead developer at iFactory, I am responsible for ensuring a high standard of work over every developer in the company.

BlahTherapy originally hired me to rebuild their heavily active chat application, this application would routinely hold between 300 and 1000 active conversations, and thus at least double that in users.

EpicWriter, a book writing application for children, was an application I built for a company called Coleman Creative in New Zealand which was aimed at school children to help them grow their storytelling skills. It involved a lot of drag and drop style UI, as well as a lot of cross platform functional testing. EpicWriter won innovateNZ (a startup competition) shortly before the app was completed.

I was tasked with building an auction application that could scale quickly, while maintaining a strong functional test base.


## Personal Projects

__EdenJS__, NodeJS Isomorphic Framework

[EdenJS](https://github.com/eden-js/eden/) is a NodeJS based isomorphic MVC framework written to bridge the gap between Symfony2 style development, and NodeJS development. Based on [RiotJS](http://riotjs.com/), [Mongorito](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/mongorito), [SocketIO](http://socket.io/) and [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/). It required mastery of those technologies, while maintaining a simple to use development style.

ChivalryIO was a NodeJS based personal wingman, which employed a mixture of human and NLP/Machine Learned responses that would attempt to find and book users last minute dates when they needed them.

__RentLar__, Rental management application

RentLar is a NodeJS based rental management platform. It provides a platform for landlords to manage and analyze their rental properties. Providing rent estimates, maintenance tracking, bank reconciliation, and accounting reports, this platform is allowing me to dive into more business focused development.
