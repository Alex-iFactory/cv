__Lead Developer__, iFactory Digital

- Web Development
- Application Development
- Team Management

As lead developer at iFactory, I am responsible for ensuring a high standard of work over every developer in the company. My tasks generally involve researching and consulting the technology stack to use for a project, talking with clients about development processes and expectations, building and maintaining a good working environment, and what would normally be expected from a standard developer. In this role I would say I am a FullStack developer cross development lead.

__Lead Developer__, BlahTherapy.com

- Web Development
- Application Development

BlahTherapy originally hired me to rebuild their heavily active chat application, this application would routinely hold between 300 and 1000 active conversations, and thus at least double that in users. My task was to rebuild this chat application, roadmap the implementation, and ensure the scaleability and performance of the legacy system during transition.

`Jan 2014 - Sep 2014`
__Lead Developer__, EpicWriter

- Web Development

EpicWriter, a book writing application for children, was an application I built for a company called Coleman Creative in New Zealand which was aimed at school children to help them grow their storytelling skills. It involved a lot of drag and drop style UI, as well as a lot of cross platform functional testing. EpicWriter won innovateNZ (a startup competition) shortly before the app was completed.

`Nov 2013 - March 2014`
__Developer__, Guang Yi Company Limited

- Application Development

Guang Yi Company Limited buys and sells used phones in China; with a turnover at the time of building this application of $200m USD, the requirements, building, and testing of the application that helped bulk auction their inventory was my sole responsibility. I was tasked with building an auction application that could scale quickly, while maintaining a strong functional test base.

`Jan 2013 - Nov 2014`
__Developer__, AdList

AdList was my first major project, and my own idea. I wanted to build a new type of P2P Auction website which acted more like the backpages of a newspaper. Using masonry javascript, I intended to sell space in a category rather than the listing itself. This gave me a lot of commercial experience both talking to other businesses, and figuring out how to build, maintain, scale, and sell an idea.

`Jan 2011 - Jan 2013`
__Freelance Developer__, Various

As a Freelance developer, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of different and challenging projects. I built anything from an adult search engine and video website, to a gaming tournament social network. During this time I sold myself as a hacker, and would rutinely take hard projects simply to learn more about what I was doing and how I would do it.


## Personal Projects

__EdenJS__, NodeJS Isomorphic Framework

[EdenJS](https://github.com/eden-js/eden/) is a NodeJS based isomorphic MVC framework written to bridge the gap between Symfony2 style development, and NodeJS development. Based on [RiotJS](http://riotjs.com/), [Mongorito](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/mongorito), [SocketIO](http://socket.io/) and [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/). It required mastery of those technologies, while maintaining a simple to use development style.

__ChivalryIO__, Online Wingman

ChivalryIO was a NodeJS based personal wingman, which employed a mixture of human and NLP/Machine Learned responses that would attempt to find and book users last minute dates when they needed them.

__RentLar__, Rental management application

RentLar is a NodeJS based rental management platform. It provides a platform for landlords to manage and analyze their rental properties. Providing rent estimates, maintenance tracking, bank reconciliation, and accounting reports, this platform is allowing me to dive into more business focused development.
